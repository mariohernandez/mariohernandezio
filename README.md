# Personal blog of Mario Hernandez

This site is proudly built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/){target=_blank rel=noopener}.

I am a Front-end Software Engineer who specializes in [Drupal](https://drupal.org) front-end development. I have been building Drupal websites since 2008 and have worked on some of the most well known brands. I am also a speaker at open source events where I talk about all things front-end and Drupal. I love writing about Drupal and Front-end development in general in my personal blog.
