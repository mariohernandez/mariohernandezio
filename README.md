# Mario Hernandez Personal Blog

Built with Eleventy (11ty) and PostCSS

## Running the site locally

As of November 11, 2023, the site requires two commands to run simultaneously in order to run and refresh when changes are made.

1. `npm start`: This will start a local server and watch for any non-CSS file changes.
1. `npm run watch:css`: This will run a postcss watch task and recompile the css code when css changes are made.

TODO:

* Clean up the base.html page once all Sass and critical styles have been completely removed and are no longer needed.
