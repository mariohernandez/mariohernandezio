First off, thanks for visiting my blog.  I hope you find the content engaging and most of all helpful as you tackle your web project.

I am Mario Hernandez, a passionate Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience.  I specialize on building [Drupal](https://drupal.org) websites and leading teams to build great user experiences. Another of my passions is training teams of all sizes on all things Front-end and Drupal.  I travel across the country to speak and run training workshops at various Open Source events such as Drupal Cons, Drupal Camps and others. As you can see I also like to write about all the cool stuff I am working on or learning about.
