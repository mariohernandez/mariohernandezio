For the past few months I've been writing a lot about Integrating Storybook with Drupal, and how to build a Drupal theme using Storybook as its design system. One thing I have not written about, until now, is how to use Single Directory Components or SDC, in a stand-alone Storybook environment. I realize there is a [Storybook module](https://drupal.org/project/sdc){target=_blank rel=noopener} but in my case, a custom Storybook implementation proved more successful than using the module. Of course, your experience with the module may be different.
