Hey you're back! ðŸ™‚ In the [previous post](../building-a-modern-drupal-theme-with-storybook), we talked about how to build a custom Drupal theme using Storybook as the design system.  We also built a simple component to demonstrate how Storybook, through the use of custom extensions, is able to understand Twig.  In this post, the focus will be on making Drupal aware of those components by connecting Drupal to Storybook.

## What is Drupal integration?

In the context of Drupal development using the component-driven methodology, Drupal integration means connecting Drupal presenter templates such as node.html.twig, block.html.twig, paragraph.html.twig, etc. to Storybook by mapping Drupal fields to component fields in Storybook. This in turn allows for your Drupal content to be rendered wrapped in the Storybook components.

The advantage of using a design system like Storybook is that you are in full control of the markup for each component. As a result your website is more semantic, accessible and easier to maintain.

## Getting the Drupal environment ready

To start let's get the Drupal environment ready to interact with Drupal and Storybook more easily.

1. Build a basic Drupal 10 website ([here are some instructions](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/#drupal){target=_blank rel=noopener}). If you already have a site you can skip this step.
1. Add the **storybook** theme to your website. If you completed the excercise in the previous post, you can copy the theme you built into your site's **/themes/custom/**. Otherwise, you can clone [the previous post repo](https://github.com/mariohernandez/storybook){target=_blank rel=nooperner} into the same location so it becomes your theme. After this your theme structure should look like this: **themes/custom/storybook**.
1. No need to enable the theme just yet. We'll comeback to the theme shortly.
1. Create a new node of type Article (be sure to include body content). We'll use this node later in the process.

## Back to Storybook

The title component we built in the previous post may not be enough to demonstrate some of the advanced techniques when integrating components. We will build a larger component to put these techniques in practice. The component we will build is called **Card** and it looks like this:

![People standing on lobby of large building](/images/storybook-card.webp){.body-image .body-image--narrow}

I like to take inventory of the different parts that make up the components I'm building. The card image above shows three parts: the image, the title, and the teaser text. Each of these parts translate into fields when I am structuring the data for the component or building the entity in Drupal.

## Building the Card component

* In your command line, navigate inside the **storybook** theme (`/themes/custom/storybook`)
* Inside the **/src/components/02-molecules** directory create a new directory called **card**
* Inside the **card** directory add the following four files:
  * **card.css**: component's styles
  * **card.twig**: component's markup and logic
  * **card.stories.jsx**: Storybook's story
  * **card.yml**: component's demo data
* Update **card.yml** as follows:
{% raw %}

```yml
---
modifier: ''
image: <img src="images/3-2.svg" alt="placeholder text" />
title:
  level: 2
  modifier: ''
  text: 'Tours & Experiences'
  url: 'https://mariohernandez.io'
teaser: 'Step inside for a tour. We offer a variety of tours and experiences to explore the buildingâ€™s architecture, take you backstage, and uncover the best food and drink. Tours are offered in different languages and for different levels of mobility.'
```

{% endraw %}

* Update **card.twig** as follows:
{% raw %}

```php
{{ attach_library('storybook/card') }}

<article class="card{{ modifier ? ' ' ~ modifier }}{{- attributes ? ' ' ~ attributes.class -}}" {{- attributes ? attributes|without(class) -}}>
  {% if image %}
    <div class="card__image">
      <figure>
        {{ image }}
      </figure>
    </div>
  {% endif %}

  <div class="card__content">
    {% if title %}
      {% include "@atoms/title/title.twig" with {
        'title': title
      } only %}
    {% endif %}

    {% if teaser %}
      <p class="card__teaser">{{ teaser }}</p>
    {% endif %}
  </div>
</article>
```

{% endraw %}

1. Update **card.css** as follows:
Copy [these styles](https://github.com/mariohernandez/storybook){target=_blank rel=noopener} into _card.css_.

{% raw %}

```css
/**
* @file
* Card component which includes title components.
*/

.card {
  display: flex;
  flex: 1 1 var(--size-44);
  flex-direction: column;
  height: auto;
  max-width: var(--size-80);
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* Using flex-grow to allow date to be positioned at the bottom of the card by
using margin-top: auto in the date wrapper field below. */
.card__content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-grow: 1;
  padding: var(--size-4);

  /* For consistent top/bottom spacing for all fields in the card. */
  > *:not(.date) {
    margin-block-end: var(--size-3);
  }
}

.card__title {
  color: var(--ucla-blue);
  font-family: var(--font-heading);
  font-size: var(--font-size-2);
  line-height: var(--leading-normal);

  &:hover {
    color: var(--gray-900);
  }
}

.card__date {
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-600);

  .date {
    font-weight: var(--font-weight-600);

    svg {
      margin-inline-end: var(--size-2);
    }
  }
}
```

{% endraw %}

1. Update **card.stories.jsx** as follows:
{% raw %}

```js
import parse from 'html-react-parser';

import card from './card.twig';
import data from './card.yml';
import './card.css';

const component = {
  title: 'Components/Card',
};

export const Card = {
  render: (args) => parse(card(args)),
  args: { ...data },
};

export default component;
```

{% endraw %}

Let's go over a few things regarding the code above:

* The data structure in **card.yml** reflects the data structure and type we will use in Drupal. The image field uses the entire `<img>` element rather than just using the image **src** and **alt** attributes.  The reason for this is when we get to Drupal, we can use Drupal's full image entity. This is recommended for caching purposes.
* **card.twig** reuses the title component we created in the previous post. This is Atomic Design in action. Because we built a flexible title component, we can use it on anything where a title is needed.
* **card.stories.jsx** is the Storybook story for the Card.  Notice how the code in this file is very similar to the code in the **title.stories.jsx**. It doesn't matter how complex a component is, when we port it into Storybook as a story, we will always have the same code as above because Storybook is simply saying: "I'll render whatever markup and logic is in Twig". There are times when additional parameters are used in the story file when we build more complex components or when we create components variations.

### Previewing the Card in Storybook

* While in the **storybook** directory, run:
{% raw %}

```shell
nvm install
npm install
npm run storybook
```

{% endraw %}

_Remember, you need NodeJS v20 or higher as well as NVM installed on your machine_.

_The Card component should be available in Storybook now._

## Prepping Drupal for integration

With the Card component now in place, let's change our attention back to Drupal. If you are following along, go ahead and complete the following tasks:

* Install and enable the [Components libraries](https://www.drupal.org/project/components){target=_blank rel=noopener} module
* Add the following at the end of **storybook.info.yml** (mind your indentation):

{% raw %}

```yml
components:
  namespaces:
    atoms:
      - src/components/01-atoms
    molecules:
      - src/components/02-molecules
    organisms:
      - src/components/03-organisms
```

{% endraw %}

* Override all content in **storybook.libraries.yml** with the following:

{% raw %}

```yml
global:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    base:
      dist/css/reset.css: {}
      dist/css/styles.css: {}

card:
  css:
    component:
      dist/css/card.css: {}

```

{% endraw %}

* Enable the Storybook theme and make it the default theme.

Let's go over the changes to both, **storybook.info.yml** and **storybook.libraries.yml** files:

* The block of code we added in **storybook.info.yml** is critical for Drupal to find our components in Storybook.  Using the Components libraries module allows us to create namespaces. Namespaces make it easier for us to tell Drupal where to look for our components since each namespace (`@atoms`, `@molecules`, etc.), is associated with a specific path to the corresponding components. This is important because Drupal by default only looks for Twig templates inside the **/templates** directory.
* We added two CSS stylesheets (reset.css and styles.css), that handle base styles in our theme. Those stylesheets are included in the Global library.  In addition, if you recall when we created the Card component, the first line inside **card.twig** is a Twig attach library statement. Using libraries is the recommended way for adding CSS and JS to pages/components.  The library does not exist so in the second part of the code snippet in **storybook.libraries.yml** we add the library so Drupal can make use of the card's CSS and JS (if available).

## Integrating the Card component

### Template suggestions

All the pieces are in place to Integrate the Card component so Drupal can use it to render each news article when viewed in Teaser mode.

* The first thing we need to do to begin the integration process is to determine which Twig template Drupal uses to render news articles in teaser view mode. One easy way to do this is to turn on Twig debugging. This used to be a complex configuration but starting with Drupal 10.1 you can now do it directly in Drupal's UI:

  * While logged in with admin access, navigate to `/admin/config/development/settings` on your browser. This will bring up the Development settings page.
  * Check all the boxes on this page and click **Save settings**.  This will enable Twig debugging and disable caching.

* With Twig debugging on, go to the homepage where the Article we created should be displayed in teaser mode. If you right-click on any part of the news article and select **inspect** from the context menu, you will see in detail all the templates Drupal is using to render the content on the current page.
**NOTE**: If your homepage does not display Article nodes in teaser view mode, you could create a simple Drupal view to list Article nodes in teaser view mode to follow along.

![Code inspector showing Drupal debugging](/images/storybook-debug.webp)
_Example of code inspector showing Drupal templates_

There are a lot of templates to see here but the ones we are interested in are the one with the name **node...***. These are the templates used to display any type of node in Drupal. In addition to template names, Twig debugging also tells us where the template being used is located (Drupal core, a module, our theme, etc.).
I have marked with an arrow the template **node.html.twig**, which is the one Drupal is currently using to render the Article node. The template with an **X** before its name is the one currently being used to render the article.
Just above the active template see a list of more templates that start with **node...**. These are known as template suggestions. Drupal is basically telling us that if we want to override the way a node is rendered, we can create a template inside our theme with any of the names being suggested.  The higher the template appears on that list, the more specific it is to the piece of content being rendered. For example, changes made to **_**node.html.twig**_** would affect ALL nodes throughout the site, whereas changes made to **node--article--teaser.html.twig** will only affect nodes of type **article** when displayed in **teaser** view mode.
With this information on hand, it is clear to us the template suggestion we need to create is **node--article--teaser.html.twig**.

#### Copy the template

It's best to create our template suggestion by copying a similar template to the one we want to create.

* Copy **/core/themes/olivero/templates/content/node--teaser.html.twig** into your theme's **/storybook/templates/content/**. Create the directory if it does not exist in yoru theme.

The template we just copied has a lot of information that may or may not be needed when integrating it with Storybook. If you recall, the Card component we built was made up of three parts: an image, a title, and teaser text.  Each of those are Drupal fields and these are the only fields we care about when integrating. Whenever I copy a template from Drupal core or a module into my theme, I like to leave the comments on the template untouched. This is helpful because this way you can reference all the details about the template as you override it.

* Rename the newly copied template to **node--article--teaser.html.twig**

### The actual integration

1. Delete everything from the newly copied template except the comments and the **classes** array variable
1. At the bottom of what is left in the template add the following code snippet:

{% raw %}

```php
{% set render_content = content|render %}

{% set article_title =
  'level': h2,
  'modifier': 'card__title',
  'text': label,
  'url': url
%}

{% include '@molecules/card/card.twig' with {
  'attributes': attributes.addClass(classes),
  'image': content.field_image,
  'title': article_title,
  'teaser': content.body,
} only %}
```

{% endraw %}

* We set a variable with `content|render` as its value. The only purpose for this variable is to make Drupal aware of the entire content array for chacing purposes.
* Next we setup a variable called **article_title** so we can structure the title field the same way the title component was built.
* We are using a Twig **include** statement with our namespace, **@molecules**, to nest the Card component into the node template. The same way we nested the Title component into the Card.
* We map Drupal's attributes into the component's attributes placeholder so Drupal can inject any attributes such as CSS classes, IDs, Data attributes, etc. into the component.  This is important because we want to make sure our components still take advantage of everything Drupal has to offer.
* Finally we map the image, title and teaser fields from Drupal to the component's equivalent fields.
* Save the changes to the template and clear Drupal's cache
* Reload the homepage and you should see the news article being rendered using the Card component. See below:
![Example of twig debugging](/images/integrated-card.webp){.body-image .body-image--narrow}
* If you right-click on the article and select **Inspect**, you will notice that Drupal is now using **node--article--teaser.html.twig** to render the article. We know this because now there is an **X** before the template name. You will also noticed that the article is using the custom markup we wrote for the Card component which is more semantic, accessible and easier to maintain.


## In closing

This is only a small example of how to build a simple component in Storybook using Twig and then integrate it with Drupal so content is rendered in a more semantic and accessible manner. There are many more advantages of implementing a system like this. I hope this was helpful and see the potential of a component-driven environment using Storybook. Thanks for visiting.
