We have come a long way in website layouts considering that at one point in time we used tables. We then learned the most amazing thing, [CSS Floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Remember this gem we used to call [The Holy Grail Layout](https://webdesignplayground.io/lessons/11-1-7/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}? Yes kids, we used to be cool ðŸ¤˜

If you've worked with Drupal in the past 10-15 years you may remember Panels, Panelizer, Display Suite, which were great tools at the time. Paragraphs and Layout Builder came to the scene and things seem to get much better. So it has been a long road but the layout journey continues with the [Experience Builder project](https://www.drupal.org/project/experience_builder){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## The good news

This post is not about droping the tools or layout techniques you have grown to love, but it is about sharing some new techniques that could help you simplify layouts and reduce code and layout templates along the way.

## CSS to the rescue


## In closing

I don't think there has ever been a more exciting time to work with CSS than now. The capabilities of CSS and browser support have never been better. Sometimes however, using some of the most basic techniques can make a great impact in our projects.

If you found this post useful, stay tuned for more like it.
