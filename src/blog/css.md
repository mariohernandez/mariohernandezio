In this blog series, I hope to share some incredible and very useful CSS tips and tricks that can help you become a better developer and enhace the UX of your website.

## Lobotomized Owls ðŸ¦‰ ðŸ¦‰

The Lobotomized Owl, or **Owl selector**, is probably one of my favorite techniques for managing document flow and achieve consistent spacing in an extremely manageable manner. Although the Owl selector may be used for other things, in this post I will focus solely in spacing between sibling elements. Let's get started.

`* + *`

The **Lobotomized Owl** is not a new CSS thing, it has been around since at least 2014 when [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} wrote about it. I highly recommend you read that article for more in-depth description of the Owl selector.

## Understanding the Owl selector

### Concept

The Owl selector allows you to manage the document flow by using the [adjacent or next sibling combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Next-sibling_combinator){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (`+`), along with the [universal selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (`*`).

### Example

Consider the following HTML:

```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
  <div class="child"></div>
  <div class="child"></div>
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```

## Scoping the Owl selector

Using the Owl selector in its original form (`* + *`), could result in unexpected updates due to its broad scope. Narrowing the scope is prefered. See examples below.

Chaining the Owl selector with `.parent >`:

```css
.parent > * + * {
  margin-block-start: 2rem;
}
```

Nesting it within `.parent` along with other rules that may exist:

```css
.parent {
  > * + * {
    margin-block-start: 2rem;
  }
}
```

By narrow the scope as shown above, and using the [child selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (`>`), a `2rem` top margin is added to "direct" children of `.parent`, but only if they have siblings.

### Visual example

A more visual representation of what the CSS is doing can be seen here:

![Four boxes representing divs](/images/blog-images/owl.webp){.body-image .body-image--narrow .body-image--left aria-hidden="true"}

FIG 1: Each white box represents a div while the purple boxes represent top margin.{.caption}

> Instead of writing styles, weâ€™ve created a style axiom: an overarching principle for the layout of content flow. - [Heydon Pickering](https://alistapart.com/author/heydonworks/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## Traditional approach for handling margin

In the past I would do something like this to handle margin on a group of elements.

```css
.my-list {
  li:not(last-child) {
    border-block-end: 1px solid #000;
  }
}
```

That's not terribly bad, but before `:not` was a thing, I would do something like this (please forgive me):

```css
.my-list {
  li {
    border-block-end: 1px solid #000;
  }
}

.my-list {
  li:last-child {
    border: 0;
  }
}
```

Now I can simply do:

```css
.my-list {
  > * + * {
    border-block-end: 1px solid #000;
  }
}
```

## A more complex example

The examples above are pretty simple but in many cases, our HTML may not be as clean or uniformed as the examples we've seen. Here's a more realistic example where our markup is a combination of different HTML tags.

```html
<article class="blog-post">

  <div class="blog-post__tag">
    <a href="#" class="eyebrow">Drupal</a>
  </div>

  <header class="blog-post__header">
    <h1 class="blog-post__title">
      Using modern image formats to improve performance
    </h1>
    <p class="blog-post__subtitle">
    Small wins, when added up can make a big difference.
    This is one of those small wins which can result in
    performance gains for your website.</p>
    <div class="blog-post__date">
      <time datetime="2025-xxx-xx">April 12, 2025</time>
    </div>
  </header>

  <div class="blog-post__share">
    <ul class="social-share" role="list">
      <li class="social-share__item">...</li>
      <li class="social-share__item">...</li>
      <li class="social-share__item">...</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-post__content">
  ...
  </div>
</article>
```

The HTML above is actually the code used on each of the blog posts on this site. Let's break it down in an ilustration form for a better visual representation.

![Visual representation of blog post markup](/images/blog-images/article.webp){.body-image .body-image--narrow .body-image--left aria-hidden="true"}

FIG 2. Illustration of the markup structure of a Blog post.{.caption}

From the code and **FIG 2** above, we notice the following:

1. The `<article>` tag is the top parent element with four direct child elements (_Tag, Header, Share, and Article content_).
1. The `<header>` tag is also a parent element itself with three direct child elements (_Title, Subtitle, and Date_).

Let's start with the `<article>` parent selector:

```css
.blog-post {
  > * + * {
    margin-block-start: 2rem;
  }
}
```

The result of this CSS rule is a 2rem top margin on direct sibling children of the `.blog-post` selector. I have highlighted in purple how this looks in FIG 3. below:

![Blog post diagram displaying margin in purple](/images/blog-images/article2.webp){.body-image .body-image--narrow .body-image--left aria-hidden="true"}

FIG 3. The purple boxes represent the space added by the CSS above.{.caption}

Now let's apply the same treatment to the `<header>`:

```css
.blog-post__header {
  > * + * {
    margin-block-start: 2rem;
  }
}
```

To make it easier to diferentiate, this time I highlighted the margin in direct sibling children of the `<header>` tag, in blue. See FIG 4. below:

![Blog post diagram displaying margin in blue](/images/blog-images/article3.webp){.body-image .body-image--narrow .body-image--left aria-hidden="true"}

FIG 4. The blue boxes represent the space added by the CSS above.{.caption}

With very little CSS code we have been able to achieve consistent spacing in direct sibling children of the `<article>` as well as nested ones inside the `<header>`.  In the spirit of staying [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, we could even combine both rules to reduce code repitition.

```css
      .blog-post,
      .blog-post__header {
  > * + * {
    margin-block-start: 2rem;
  }
}
```

## What if the HTML structure changes?

It's not uncommom for the HTML of a document to change. Some of my blog posts for example have subtitle text while others don't. The beauty of the Owl selector is that it is not depending on the specific HTML tags in your document.

## What about Gap?

Oh yes, enough about Owls ðŸ¦‰, Gap is a beautiful thing and can even be used similarly to the Owl selector for adding space in between sibling child elements.

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

### Pros of gap

* The CSS block above will behave exactly as the Owl technique, as in it will only add space between sibling child elements.
* Another advantage of using Gap for spacing, is that when it comes to responsive design, the gap rules you apply to elements for mobile, will remain in place as you transition to tablet or desktop. This means if in mobile your elements were stacked in column direction, but in desktop they change to row, the gap rules will still apply as long as your child elements are siblins. See FIG 5. below.

![Example of gap settings on sibling elements](/images/blog-images/gap.webp){.body-image .body-image--wide .body-image--left aria-hidden="true"}

FIG 5. Visual of Gap on column and row mode.{.caption}

### Cons of gap

If you opt to use Gap for spacing, this means you either need to use `display: flex` or `display: grid` on the parent element. This is not a bad thing if you are already using flex or grid on that parent element, but if your only reason for using gap is for spacing purposes, then I would recommend using the Owl technique instead as it requires not additional properties on your parent selector.

## In closing

I don't think there has ever been a more exciting time to work with CSS than now. The capabilities of CSS and browser support have never been better. Sometimes however, using some of the most basic techniques can make a great impact in our projects.
